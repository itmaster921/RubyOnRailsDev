    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    We primarily use the information we collect through the Amper Sports Platforms to help you book courts and purchase products through the Amper Sports
    Platform and to communicate with you regarding news, special offers and other information.
</p>
<p>
    We may share the information we collect through the Amper Sports Platforms with our vendors and partners, including marketing partners and the sports
    venues at which you reserve courts using the Amper Sports Platforms. We may also share information about you for legal and business reasons. Click here for

</p>
<p>
    The Amper Sports Platforms may contain content served by third parties, including videos and advertisements, and we work with third party service providers
    to serve Amper Sports advertisements elsewhere online. In connection with serving content and providing analytics and advertising services, third parties
    may collect certain information about your visits to this or other web sites and we may receive information regarding the use of the Amper Sports Platforms
    and the effectiveness of our advertisements. These advertising networks, advertisers, ad agencies, analytics service providers and other vendors may set

    by participating companies.
</p>
<p>
    The Amper Sports Platforms may contain features that enable interaction between you, the Amper Sports Platforms and third party platforms and features.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>INFORMATION COLLECTION</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>1. Registration and Other Information You Provide</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Amper Sports Platforms may collect "Personal Information" (information that identifies you as a specific individual, such as your full name or e-mail
    address), account information (password or other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your account) and demographic or other
    information (such as your zip code and information about your interests and preferences). We will also collect payment information if you choose to
    purchase products or services through the Amper Sports Platforms. We may also collect information, including Personal Information, about other members of
    your sports party which you may submit to us when you use the Amper Sports Platforms. If we combine demographic or similar information with the Personal
    Information we collect, we will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.
</p>
<p>
    Our services are general audience services and are not intended for individuals younger than the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal
    Information from individuals younger than the age of 13. If Amper Sports discovers that it has inadvertently collected personal information from anyone
    younger than the age of 13, it will delete that information. In addition, you must be at least 18 years of age or have a parental consent to make a
    purchase through the Amper Sports Platforms.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2. Information Third Parties Provide About You</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, someone may provide information about you in order to reserve a racquet sport court
    on your behalf or to send you information or a gift card through the Amper Sports Platforms. We may combine this information in our database and we may use
    it to contact you about a reserved court or other product purchased for you, or to offer you products or services, or for similar purposes. Third parties
    also may forward your information to us; for example, if you are using a service that uses the Amper Sports Platforms or an Amper Sports application
    program interface (API) to present available racquet sport courts. We also may supplement the information we collect with outside records from third
    parties. If we combine the information we receive from others with information we collect through the Amper Sports Platforms, we will apply this Privacy
    Policy to the combined information.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>3. Social Media/Integration With Third Party Platforms</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Amper Sports Platforms may permit you to interact with a third party site or service, such as enabling you to "like" us on another site or "share"
    content from an Amper Sports Platform with other sites. If you choose to "like" or "share" content or to otherwise post information from or via the Amper
    Sports Platforms to a third party site or service, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party may have access to certain information
    about you and your use of the Amper Sports Platforms. Similarly, if you interact with us through a third party site, we may have access to information
    about you (for example, if you "like" or "follow" our page on a third party site).
</p>
<p>
    You may also choose to use a social media tool offered by a third party, but available on an Amper Sports Platform (such as posting a review or logging
    into the Amper Sports Platforms with your username and password for another site). Use of such a feature may allow us to collect (or the third party to
    share) information about you, including Personal Information. When you choose to use a social media tool available on an Amper Sports Platform, you may be
    opting to link your activities on the Amper Sports Platform with a third party site or service. That third party may collect information about your visits
    to the Amper Sports Platforms and may publish that activity to your profile or similar feature on that third party site (such as if you choose to share one
    of your sports venue reviews from the Amper Sports Platforms with your connections on the third party site). The information we collect is subject to this
    Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third
    party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third
    party site.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>4. Public Forums and User Content</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Amper Sports Platforms may provide features through which you can publicly post content (comments, racquet sport scores, messages, images, videos, text
    or other material). If you post any content through the Amper Sports Platforms or otherwise submit any content to Amper Sports, you grant to us a license
    as set forth in the Terms Of Use.
</p>
<p>
    Note that anything you post publicly may be viewed by others. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information or other information publicly,
    that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>5. Information We Collect Automatically</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Amper Sports, and our third party service providers (including analytics providers and third party content providers), may automatically collect certain

    engine that lead you to the Amper Sports Platforms (if applicable), all of the areas within the Amper Sports Platforms that you visit, and the time of day
    you used the Amper Sports Platform, among other information relating to your use of the Amper Sports Platforms. We may use Usage Information for a variety

    display to you.
</p>
<p>
    In addition, we automatically collect your IP address or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier") for any computer, mobile phone or tablet, or other
    device you may use to access the Amper Sports Platforms. A Device Identifier is a number that is automatically assigned or connected to the device you use
    to access a Service, and our servers identify your device by its Device Identifier. Some mobile service providers may also provide us or our third party
    service providers with information regarding the physical location of the device used to access a Service. Usage Information is generally non-identifying,
    but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we treat it as Personal Information.

</p>
<p>
    For legal related reasons, such as in response to a subpoena or when required by law, to defend our rights or to protect the personal safety, rights,
    property or security of any organization or individual, or in response to a written request from law enforcement regarding an investigation into criminal
    activity that may have occurred through or in any way using the Amper Sports Platforms. We may also provide information to defend against any assertion of
    breach of our Terms of Use or other policies applicable to the Amper Sports Platforms or to a claimed owner of intellectual property who claims that
    content you provided infringes on their rights. We may use Device Identifiers, including IP addresses, to identify users, and may do so in cooperation with
    copyright owners, Internet service providers, wireless service providers or law enforcement agencies in our discretion.
</p>

    advertisements elsewhere online, and to provide us with information regarding the use of the Amper Sports Platforms and the effectiveness of our
