<p>
    <strong>Reporting Copyright and Other Intellectual Property Violations.</strong>
    You may not use an Amper Sports Platform for any purpose or in any manner that infringes the rights of any third party. Amper Sports encourages you to
    report any content on an Amper Sports Platform that you believe infringes your rights. Only the intellectual property rights owner or person authorized to
    act on behalf of the owner can report potentially infringing content. If you have a good faith belief that content on an Amper Sports Platform infringes
    your copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights, please follow the procedures set forth below.
</p>
<p>
    In accordance with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 (the <strong>'DMCA'</strong>), Amper Sports has a designated agent for receiving notices of
    copyright infringement and Amper Sports follows the notice and take down procedures of the DMCA. If you believe that your work has been copied in a way
    that constitutes copyright infringement, please provide Amper Sports' copyright agent the following information required by the Online Copyright
    Infringement Liability Limitation Act of the DMCA, 17 U.S.C. 512: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the
    owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed; (b) identification of the copyright work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple
    copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site; (c) identification of the
    material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and information reasonably sufficient to permit us to locate the
    material; (d) information reasonably sufficient to permit us to contact the complaining party; (e) a statement that the complaining party has a good-faith
    belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and (f) a statement that the
    information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an
    exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
</p>
<p>
    If you believe that any content on an Amper Sports Platform violates your rights other than copyrights, please provide Amper Sports with at least the
    following information: (a) a physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
    infringed; (b) identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and information reasonably
    sufficient to permit us to locate the material; (c) an explanation of what rights you own/have and why you believe the content infringes your rights
    sufficient for us to evaluate your complaint; and (d) accurate contact information for you.
</p>
<p>
    NOTE: This contact information is for inquiries regarding potential copyright and other infringement only.
</p>
<p>
    We have a policy of terminating the accounts of users who (in our reasonable discretion) are repeat infringers.
</p>
<p>
    It is often difficult to determine if your intellectual property rights have been violated or if the DMCA requirements have been met. We may request
    additional information before we remove any infringing material. If a dispute develops as to the correct owner of the rights in question, we reserve the
    right to remove your content along with that of the alleged infringer pending resolution of the matter.
</p>
<p>
    Amper Sports will provide you with notice if your materials have been removed based on a third party complaint of alleged infringement of the third party's
    intellectual property rights.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Viral Distribution and Widgets.</strong>
    Amper Sports may allow you – but only through express written permission – to engage in certain personal uses of Platform Content that include the ability
    to share Platform Content with others (<strong>'Viral Distribution'</strong>). For example, an Amper Sports Platform may allow you to send Platform Content
    to friends, display Platform Content on your personal web site or post Platform Content on a third party web site. You agree that you will not imply that
    you and Amper Sports are affiliated in any way or that Amper Sports approves of your comments. We reserve the right to revoke our permission for Viral
    Distribution at any time and for any reason and you agree to immediately cease Viral Distribution upon notice of revocation and to comply with any terms we
    post in connection the Viral Distribution of Platform Content.
</p>
<p>
    Similarly, an Amper Sports Platform may provide content that you may choose to embed on your personal web page, third party web site or social networking
    site by pasting the HTML or other code provided by us (typically labeled as an embed code) (<strong>'Widgets'</strong>). Widgets are Platform Content. We
    may discontinue providing the services necessary for the Widgets to operate or we may disable Widgets you have embedded at any time for any reason without
    any liability to you. You agree that our permission to you to use Widgets on your Personal Page does not provide you (or any third party) with any
    intellectual property rights in or to the Widget or any Platform Content made available via any Widget. Some Widgets and Platform Content are only made
    available for use pursuant to a separate agreement between Amper Sports and the user.
</p>
<p>
    NOTICE TO THIRD PARTY SITES: Any Platform Content made available in connection with your site, or otherwise, by our Widgets, third party widgets or
    otherwise, is our exclusive property and no grant of any intellectual property rights is made by us. We retain the right to demand that you cease any use
    of our Platform Content upon notice.

    permit interactions between the Amper Sports Platforms and a third party website or online feature, including applications that connect the Amper Sports

    your Content with a third party, which may be publicly posted on that third party’s web site. Using this functionality typically requires you to login to
    your account on the third party site and you do so at your own risk. We do not control any of these third party sites or any of their content. Accordingly,
    you expressly acknowledge and agree that we are in no way responsible or liable for any of those third party sites or online features.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
    <strong>Legal Disputes/Arbitration.</strong>
    If a dispute arises between you and Amper Sports, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly.
    Accordingly, you agree that we will resolve any claim or controversy at law or equity that relates to or arises out of these Terms or an Amper Sports
    Platform (a <strong>'Claim'</strong>) in accordance with the subsections below.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        General. You and Amper Sports agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination,
        enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof (collectively, <strong>'Disputes'</strong>) will be settled by binding arbitration; except that either
        party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court.
        <strong>
            You acknowledge and agree that you and Amper Sports are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member
            in any purported class action or representative proceeding.
        </strong>
        Further, unless both you and Amper Sports otherwise agree, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise
        preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this 'Legal
        Disputes/Arbitration' section will be deemed void. This 'Legal Disputes/Arbitration' section will survive any termination of these Terms.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party reserves the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction with
        respect to any dispute related to the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's intellectual property or
        proprietary rights or breach of the Your Content provisions of these Terms (collectively, 'Excluded Disputes').
    </li>
    <li>
Arbitration Rules, Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ('<strong>AAA</strong>') in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the '<strong>AAA Rules</strong>') then in effect, except as modified by this Section of these Terms. (The AAA Rules are available at        <a href='http://www.adr.org/arb_med'>http://www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern
        the interpretation and enforcement of this Section. These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of Delaware
        without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any action taken in a small claims court as contemplated by
        these terms will be the courts located in the State of Delaware and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such
        courts.
    </li>
    <li>
        Arbitration Process. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the
        AAA Rules (The AAA provides form Demands for Arbitration at <a href='http://www.adr.org/'>www.adr.org</a>). The arbitrator will be either a retired
        judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of Delaware and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute
        arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will
        appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
    </li>
    <li>
        Arbitration Location and Procedure. Unless you and Amper Sports otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If
        your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Amper Sports submit to the
        arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a
        hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of
        information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
    </li>
    <li>
        Arbitrator's Decision. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the
        essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having
        jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the Limitation of Liability section of these Terms as to the
        types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the
        claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be
        entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Amper Sports will not seek, and hereby waives all
        rights it may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys' fees and expenses if it prevails in arbitration.
    </li>
    <li>
        Fees. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your
        claim for damages does not exceed $750, Amper Sports will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the
        relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal
        Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).
    </li>
    <li>
        Changes. If Amper Sports changes this Legal Disputes/Arbitration section, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by
        email to topias@ampersports.com) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the 'Effective Date ' date. By rejecting any
        change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and Amper Sports in accordance with the provisions of this Section as of the
        date you first accepted these Term (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms).
    </li>
    <li>
        Venue. You agree that any action at law or in equity relating to the arbitration provision of these Terms or the Excluded Disputes will be filed only
        in the state or federal courts located in Delaware and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of
        litigating any such action.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Assignment.</strong>
    In our sole discretion, we may assign these Terms without notice to you. You may not assign these Terms without our prior written consent.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>No Waiver.</strong>
    The waiver by either party of any breach of these Terms will not be construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach or any other covenant. All waivers
    must be in writing, and signed by the party waiving its rights.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Severability.</strong>
    If any term of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or contrary to law, it will be modified to the least extent necessary to make it enforceable, and
    the remaining portions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Our Right To Update These Terms.</strong>
    We reserve the right to modify or add to these Terms at any time without prior notice ('Updated Terms'). You agree that we may notify you of the Updated
    Terms by posting them on the Amper Sports Platforms so that they are accessible via a link on the home page, and that your use of the Amper Sports
    Platforms after we have posted the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated
    Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms before using the Amper Sports Platforms. The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or
    such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms, and will apply to your use of the Amper Sports Platforms from that point forward.
</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
    <br/>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Entire Agreement.</strong>
    These Terms constitutes the entire agreement between you and Amper Sports with respect to your use of the Amper Sports Platforms and supersedes all prior
    agreements, proposals, negotiations, representations or communications.
